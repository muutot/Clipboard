# Clipboard repository instructions

Before changing this repository, read `.opencode/skills/clipboard-dev/SKILL.md` completely and follow its linked maintenance workflow.

In particular:

- Audit TODO completion from direct evidence before checking an item.
- Preserve the approved main-page style and apply the settings style gate before CSS changes.
- Keep parallel agent ownership non-overlapping.
- Commit one verified minimal feature or fix at a time.
- **Commit message must follow gitmoji format:** `<emoji> <type>[<scope>]: <message>` (e.g., `✨ feat[search]: add pagination`, `🐛 fix[viewer]: correct fullscreen crash`, `📝 docs[release]: ...`). See full type/emoji table in `.opencode/skills/clipboard-dev/SKILL.md:96-135`.
